## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*Answer* :
- I feel very good about asking questions! I know it is important to google and do self-research on our own during this program first. However, if I am still stuck, I want to be someone who creates a working team of classmates to ask questions, as well as help answer them for others! I think I wait the right amount of time to ask questions. Having been a teacher, I know it is valuable to ask questions in a classroom setting, since other students also will have similar questions.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*Answer*
- It felt fine having less supports. I made a point to go back to section 1 to refresh myself on some of the steps and processes, which helped. It was only uncomfortable initially, because I had to do extra navigation in resources or online. It is helping me to become more self-sufficient, as well as become aware of the multitude of resources and videos online!

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

*Answer*
- A conditional statement is an if/else if/else function. It is a scenario where multiple outcomes can be achieved based on the data that is input. A daily life conditional would be weather based. If it is sunny, I will wear light clothes. But, if it is raining, I will wear a rain jacket. An example of a web application that uses a conditional would be a banking app. If I want to withdraw money, it will reject the withdrawal if I ask for more than I have in my account, or it will approve the withdrawal if I ask for and equal or lesser value than I have in my account.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

*Answer*
- You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, by using the conditions: `else if` and `else`. Squiggly brackets are needed as well. The program will first check to see if the initial `if` condition is met. If so (if true), it will return the statement/value logged below. If that first statement is false, then it will move on to the next `else if`, or `else` statement to check if that is true. This continues until a condition is true, or the `else` statement will be invoked if all other conditions are false.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

*Answer*
- As a developer, I am now able to use the two "Logical Operators": "and" and "or". The "and" (&&) logical operator will check to see if both statements are true. The "or" logical operator (||) will check to see if one or the other of the statements are true.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

*Answer*
- I am still a bit confused about which statement is best to put first when doing an `if` statement function. I think it is nice for the false statements to be checked initially, rather than have the first statement return as true, where the others are not considered. Also, I am wondering if I can have more than 2 statements analyzed in one line of code.

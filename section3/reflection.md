## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

*Answer*
  a. Remembering to take time to reflect is something that I want to utilize more often as I learn and grow as a developer. Reflecting on things that I have learned and have been successful with is one part, but also reflecting on my challenges and struggles with an "I can do it, or figure it out" mindset will be extremely beneficial during this journey!
  b. Using SMART goals can be very helpful for me. I have not been great at goal setting in the past. A lot of that is due to setting too many goals/ tasks for myself at once. By chunking goals, setting time frames for them, and making them measurable, I can break them down into smaller pieces. I will find accomplishment in the small steps that lead to larger goals, rather than feeling defeated that I did not accomplish my overall goal in one sitting or day.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*Answer*
- Having been in education, as well as reflecting on my time as a student, I know how important a positive (growth) mindset can be. Going into a new task or challenge with the belief that I can succeed through hard work, asking questions, and persevering, has made me successful at times. Practice truly does make "perfect", or at least enables us to make strides towards becoming a better version of ourselves, or more capable at a task. I also am someone who is quick to ask questions!

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

*Answer*
- When looking at sports statistics on ESPN or for fantasy football, an array would be used to capture all of the different stat types when showing stats and percentages

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

*Answer*
- An Array method is used to group together multiple data types. They can be all strings, all numbers, or other data types. But an Array method is used to make one list that can be referenced using the same variable.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

*Answer*
- A loop is used when we want to look at multiple/a lot of data. The computer can do this much faster than humans, by using an array. Whereas we would need to evaluate or sort them individually, or much slower. A loop is used most commonly in conjunction with an array to determine if conditional statements about the array elements are true or false. A loop can be used without an array if we want to print a statement multiple times about a single variable.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

*Answer*
- A loop is used when we want to compare a list of people or things. For example: we could use a loop to determine which students who's first name starts with "A". We can count the number of students in the class first. Then put their names in a list (array), and have the computer check to see which students have a name that starts with "A". This saves us time, rather than going around to each student and checking their name!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- The syntax is still a bit iffy for me at times. Arrays seem straight forward, but it seems like there can be some caveats when working with loops. I am understanding elements and index positions better, but a few of the questions took a good bit of time.

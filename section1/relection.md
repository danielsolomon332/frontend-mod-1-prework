## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Answer:
- Needing to read a lot resonates with me. There is a lot of reading and analyzing to be done to become better at coding. Also, reading in general is healthy for our brains!

- I already try to maintain a growth mindset, which allows me to try and figure out new solutions to the many issues and challenges we face in Turing.

- I need to start taking more short breaks while working through exercises for our projects. This will help me stay sharp and will help me avoid becoming frustrated at times!

- I would add in "staying confident in my ability to learn, grow and succeed"

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Answer:
- The 3 data types that we learned about in the section were: strings, numbers, and booleans.

- Strings = contain number(s), letter(s), special character(s), etc.
  - They are wrapped in quotes and often result in a sentence or statement
  - Ex: "Turing is a journey"

- Numbers = numeric values
  - Integers are numbers that are whole positive or negative values
  - Floats are numbers that contain a partial Integer
    - Ex: 3.75 or -4.16

- Booleans = true or false statements
    - They provide a true or false response to a variable name that is somewhat of a question (true/false)
    - Ex: var isHungry = true

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

Answer:
console.log("Hello World");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Answer:
To indicate a comment in Javascript, we use the double backslash (//)
  - The purpose of a code comment is to explain a process or line of code to the reader or someone that might look at our code

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

Answer:
- A variable is like an "empty box" (placeholder)
- We need to define what word or number that we are going to place in the "box"

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Answer:
- Site: ESPN
  - Three variables that ESPN probably use:
    - var teamName
      - teamName would be a string, since it is a collection of letters
    - var gameScore
      - gameScore would be a number, or string of numbers, that show the resulting score of the game
    -var gameResult
      - gameResult could be a boolean, since it could return (Win or Lose), similar to (True or False)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Answer:
- Concatenation is when we join strings together.
- We can concatenate the different data types together to form a sentence or statement.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Answer:
- Site: ESPN
  - ESPN might use concatenation to combine the team names, game score values, and other words in sentences to create write-ups of games.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Answers:
- 1. I am having an issue with the terminal printing my written responses to question in the exercises.
  - I used the // to make a comment when writing responses. I am worried my grading instructor will not see these responses if they simply print the files. I was running into errors printing the entire files, which is why I used this approach. The rest of my work printed fine!
  - My question is, "why can I not just type an answer response without it returning an error?"

- 2. I am wondering if we should stick to either concatenation or interpolation for consistency's sake?
  - Both of these approaches seem to yield the same result, so I am not sure if it is best to be consistent with one, or if there are specific times where one or the other is more appropriate or necessary?

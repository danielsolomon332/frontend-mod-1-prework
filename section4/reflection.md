## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

*Answer*
- It was a big change! I often sit at my desk for long periods of time without watching the clock. This forced me to take some short physical/mental breaks. I felt more refreshed and happy when I sat back down!

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

*Answer*
- I am classically bad at estimating times. The Pomodoro technique helped me to set shorter time-based goals. I feel like I was more focused, because I had a break to look forward to!

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

*Answer*
- An Object is a "container". I view it as a variable/array hybrid. For example, if we create an object for "car", it will contain multiple key/value pairs that are descriptors/values linked to the "car" object. Objects are a great way to describe an item/thing that has multiple sub properties.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

*Answer*
- This would be an array. Because, it is simply a list of students.

  * List of states and their capitals

*Answer*
-  This would be an object. We would have "states" as the class, and "states" as the property.

  * List of things to pack for vacation

*Answer*
- This would be an array. There is no need for sub descriptions. This is simply a list of items to pack.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

*Answer*
- This would be an array. There is no need for sub descriptions. This is simply a list of the Instagram accounts I follow.

  * List of student names and their cohort

*Answer*
- This would be an object. We would have "student names" as the class, and "cohort" as the property.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

*Answer*
- This would be an object. We would have "ingredient" as the class, and "amount" as the property.

  * All my favorite restaurants

*Answer*
- This would be an array. There is no need for sub descriptions. This is simply a list of my favorite restuarants.


1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

*Answer*
- When looking at a team page on ESPN, you would see a bunch of properties listed for the "team" class. Properties could be "team record", "points scored", etc.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

*Answer*
- No major questions. It is definitely starting to click after all of the practice! Being careful with the syntax will be my biggest focus.
